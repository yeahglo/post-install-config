**_We start by logging into our Agent Login Page for osTicket._** 

<br/>

**Step 1: Create a Role** - Roles determine levels of access.
- Navigage to Admin panel > Agents > Roles > Add New Role
- Name the role "Supreme Admin"
- Checkmark all permissions under Tickets, Tasks, and Knowledgebase

<br/>

**_Create the Supreme Admin Role._**

<img width="1096" alt="Screen Shot 2023-07-10 at 8 38 24 AM" src="https://github.com/yeahglo/post-install-config/assets/91516100/f96fa232-d29c-42ce-b204-a94779417277">

**_For our Supreme Admin, we're turning all of these permissions on. Notice there are plenty of permissions you can adjust under Tickets, Tasks and Knowledgebase._**

<br/>

**Step 2: Create a Department** - Departments determine ticket routing and allow you to customize settings.
- Navigage to Admin panel > Agents > Roles > Add New Department
- Name the department "System Administrators"
- Leave the defaults settings for now

<br/>

<img width="1200" alt="Screen Shot 2023-07-10 at 8 47 15 AM" src="https://github.com/yeahglo/post-install-config/assets/91516100/40d692b0-9e32-4a4a-8a5a-cbecf5ee427e">

**_We are using the default settings for the Systems Administrator Department, but note, you can assign SLAs at this level._**

<br/>

**Step 3: Create a Team** - Teams allow you to pull agents for specific use cases.
- Navigage to Admin panel > Agents > Roles > Add New Team
- Create a "Level II Support" (we already have a Level I as a default)

<br/>

**_Again, you have the option to add more settings at the Team level, including assigning a team lead or adding members as you set up the team._**

<br/>

**Step 4: Allow anonymous users to create tickets** - Doing this ensures that our users, aka "ticket owners", can create tickets easily.
- Admin Panel > Settings > User Settings > uncheck “Require registration and login to create tickets”

<br/>

**_At this time, the default is already unchecked so we just need to review this._**

<br/>

**Step 5: Create an Agent** - Agents are help desk professionals who work the tickets.
- Navigate to Admin Panel > Agents > Add New Agent
- Name the agent "Anthony Torres"
- Add Anthony's department as System Administrators
- Assign the Supreme Admin role for him
- Assign him to the Level II Support Team
- Add Support under the Extended Access so he can view/edit tickets

<br/>

**_The agent profile has many options to set access and permissions._**

<br/>

<img width="1207" alt="Screen Shot 2023-07-10 at 8 59 04 AM" src="https://github.com/yeahglo/post-install-config/assets/91516100/b597218c-86e8-43f9-b19f-eafdfd86dbd5">

**_Under the agent profile, osTicket lets you set and change the password as long as you have the permissions to change this._**

<br/>

**Step 6: Create a User** - Users create support tickets to get assistance from agents.
- Navigate to Agent Panel > Users > Add User (Note: You can also import users)
- Name the User "Dylan Thompson" and add an email for them

<br/>

**_Users are the ticket owners. It's possible to create them one by one, but you can also import them in bulk._**

<br/>

**Step 7: Create an SLA** - Service Level Agreements (SLAs) define what kind of response time is warranted for each ticket.
- Navigate to Admin Panel > Manage > SLA > Add New SLA Plan
- Name the SLA Plan "SEV-A" and set it on a 24/7 schedule with a 1-hour grace period

<br/>

<img width="1208" alt="Screen Shot 2023-07-10 at 9 21 25 AM" src="https://github.com/yeahglo/post-install-config/assets/91516100/24720102-a884-4e04-bf8c-831ee9cf867d">

**_SLAs can be set up to define what kind of timeline each ticket has in order to remain compliant with the service contract._**

<br/>

**Step 8: Create a Help Topic** - Help Topics allow users to set a category for their ticket.
- Navigate to Admin Panel > Manage > Help Topics > Add New Help Topic
- Name the Help Topic "Personal Computer Issues"

<br/>

<img width="1243" alt="Screen Shot 2023-07-13 at 9 38 00 AM" src="https://github.com/yeahglo/post-install-config/assets/91516100/01c09ec5-eec5-4ec2-94b6-9601455c9f40">

**_Help Topics will be visible to users to assign to individual tickets. Note the option to create parent/child relationships and to customize further under the Tickets and Forms tabs._**
